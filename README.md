- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jjdcorke (JÃ©rÃ©mie Corkery)
I'm a 3rd year mathematical physics undegraduate student at the University of Waterloo! I'm extremely i terested in computational physics and Machine Learning applied in physics. Currently looking for a Co-Op for Spring 2022 school term (May-August). 

Coding Experience
=================

My experience coding largely revolves around leveraging numerical methods and algorithms to solve probelms from a wide variety of topics in physics such as classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, astronomy, etc. This experience mainly comes from having taken the Computational Physics 1-2 courses at UW (PHYS 236/239) which were taught in **Python**. In these, we covered various integration/differentiation schemes, curve fitting, differential equations (IVP/BVP), as well as monte-carlo methods. For more in depth breakdown of topics/examples see *Computational Physics 2nd Edition by Mark Newmann* 

I've also recently completed PHYS 449: Machine Learning in Physics where we covered theoretically and implemented a wide variety of ML algorithms for various tasks. We started with simple linear-regression and multiple linear regression which we implemented from scratch. From there, we covered vanilla NN (neural network) and convolutional NN for classification, prediction and approximation and implemented an MNIST classifier. we then covered recurrent networks and sequencial models where we implemented a neural ODE solver to learn a vector field associated with the DE and plot a solution given inital conditions. We also covered energy based models and implemented a fully visible Bolztmann machine. We then covered generative models and implmented a variational autoencoder to generate MNIST-like digits. We briefly covered transformers, attention based models and reinforcement learning. Let me know if you would like access to these and I will gladly give it to you.

Our final group project for this course was attempting to replicate results from a paper using machine learning for physics related applications. The paper my group chose was *Learning Mesh-Based Simulations Using Graph Networks* by Pfaff et al. We were successful in replication of results and actually improved the model with global self-attention and self-correcting rollouts. These modifications allowed the model to exhibit better stability when compared to the original work and ground truth. The powerpoint deck and github repo will soon be available for those interested in the new year.

Inrecently took a stellar astrophysics course where we used code for various applications including solving stellar structure equations. this code can be found under PHYS 375. 

I also have a strong interest in real-time simulation applications (i.e. game engines) and am currently learning implement path tracing from peter shirley's resource along with and game engine architecture from the book *Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory*. I am using this as a way to learn C++ as a side project and I am just starting. This interest is split between real-time computer graphics and real-time physics simulation. I also have a working knowledge of HTML/CSS, Swift and LISP as learned through code academy and other sources.
