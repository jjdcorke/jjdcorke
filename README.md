- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jjdcorke
I'm a 3rd year mathematical physics undegraduate student at the University of Waterloo! I'm currently working on a computational physics library as
a personal project with my friend. More information to follow soon. 

Coding Experience
=================

My experience coding largely revolves around leveraging numerical methods and algorithms to solve probelms from a wide variety of topics in physics such as classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, astronomy, etc. This experience mainly comes from having taken the Computational Physics 1-2 courses at UW (PHYS 236/239) which were taught in **Python**. In these, we covered various integration/differentiation schemes, curve fitting, differential equations (IVP/BVP), as well as monte-carlo methods. For more in depth breakdown of topics/examples see *Computational Physics 2nd Edition by Mark Newmann* 

I also have a strong interest in real-time simulation applications (i.e. game engines) and am currently learning game engine architecture along with **C++** from the book *Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory*. This interest is split between real-time computer graphics and real-time physics simulation.
