- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jjdcorke (JÃ©rÃ©mie Corkery)
I'm a 3rd year mathematical physics undegraduate student at the University of Waterloo! I'm currently working on a computational physics library as
a personal project with my friend. More information to follow soon. 

Coding Experience
=================

My experience coding largely revolves around leveraging numerical methods and algorithms to solve probelms from a wide variety of topics in physics such as classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, astronomy, etc. This experience mainly comes from having taken the Computational Physics 1-2 courses at UW (PHYS 236/239) which were taught in **Python**. In these, we covered various integration/differentiation schemes, curve fitting, differential equations (IVP/BVP), as well as monte-carlo methods. For more in depth breakdown of topics/examples see *Computational Physics 2nd Edition by Mark Newmann* 

I've also recently completed PHYS 449: Machine Learning in Physics where we covered theoretically and implemented a wide variety of ML algorithms for various tasks. We started with simple linear-regression and multiple linear regression which we implemented from scratch. From there, we covered vanilla NN (neural network) and convolutional NN for classification, prediction and approximation and implemented an MNIST classifier. we then covered recurrent networks and sequencial models where we implemented a neural ODE solver to learn a vector field associated with the DE and plot a solution given inital conditions. We also covered energy based models and implemented a fully visible Bolztmann machine. We then covered generative models and implmented a variational autoencoder to generate MNIST-like digits. We briefly covered transformers, attention based models and reinforcement learning. These sample work will soon be available (they are not currently as they are being graded), however if you would like access to them send me a message and I'll gladly give it to you. 

Our final group project for this course was attempting to replicate results from a paper using machine learning for physics related applications. The paper my group chose was *Learning Mesh-Based Simulations Using Graph Networks* by Pfaff et al. We were successful in replication of results and actually improved the model with global self-attention and self-correcting rollouts. These modifications allowed the model to exhibit better stability when compared to the original work and ground truth. The powerpoint deck and github repo will soon be available for those interested in the new year.

I also have a strong interest in real-time simulation applications (i.e. game engines) and am currently learning game engine architecture along with **C++** from the book *Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory*. This interest is split between real-time computer graphics and real-time physics simulation. I am doing so in my own time but my goal is to eventually develop an independent title as well as working more closely with game engines. 

I also have a working knowledge of HTML/CSS, Swift and LISP as learned through code academy and other sources.
