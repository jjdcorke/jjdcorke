    "In condensed matter physics, the Madelung constant gives the total electric potential felt by an atom in a solid. It depends on the charges of the other atoms nearby and their locations. Consider for instance solid sodium chloride — table salt. The sodium chloride crystal has atoms arranged on a cubic lattice, but with alternating sodium and chlorine atoms, the sodium ones having a single positive charge $+e$ and the chlorine ones a single negative charge $−e$, where $e$ is the charge on the electron. If we label each position on the lattice by three integer coordinates $(i, j, k)$, then the sodium atoms fall at positions where $i + j + k$ is even, and the chlorine atoms at positions where $i + j + k$ is odd.\n",
